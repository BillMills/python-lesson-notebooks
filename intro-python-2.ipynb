    "In the [previous lesson](https://github.com/BillMills/python-lesson-notebooks/blob/master/intro-python-1.ipynb), we learned about how to store information in *variables*, and store instructions in *functions* for later use. In this lesson, we'll learn the basic tools for making our programs smarter: *loops*, which allow our programs to repeat themselves many times, and *conditions*, which allow our programs to make simple decisions for themselves. First though, we'll start by learning about a new type of variable, called a *list*."
